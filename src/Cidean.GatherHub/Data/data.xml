            <p>This very special walking tour digs into how and why the 1893 Worldâ€™s Fair captures imaginations more than any other event in Chicago history. Unlike other Worldâ€™s Fair tours andÂ Devil in the White CityÂ tours, which likely revolve around facts and trivia, youâ€™ll dig deeper on this tour.</p>
            <p>On this fun and insightful walkingÂ tour,Â youâ€™ll venture into beautiful architectural spaces from the era. You will play a fewÂ thoughtfully designed games, likeÂ visual scavenger hunts. Along with guide commentary, your guide will show you on shared iPads material fromÂ archives and photographs that illuminate this event, also known as the 1893 Worldâ€™s Columbian Exposition.</p>
            <p>ThisÂ downtown tour visits some of the few remaining and spectacular buildings from the time of the Worldâ€™s Fair. The fairgrounds themselves were south of downtown, but you can best see the impact of the fair in the Loop. Here the architecture and landscape still show the Worldâ€™s Fair imprint even today, nearly 125 years later. And beyond just looking at buildings from outside, our mostly indoor walking tour sees the beauty of architectural details within.</p>
            <p>On this walking tour, you will eat a couple light snacks (we used to call this a â€œfood tourâ€ but have minimized the food, just fyi in case youâ€™re reading reviews onÂ YelpÂ orÂ TripAdvisor). Plus, you can opt to get drinks (on you), too!</p>
            <p>You can think of this 2.75-hour-long walking tour as being 5% outdoors, 95% indoors, 20% clue-based games and visual scavenger hunts, 10% drinking time, and 100% awesome historical tour time. We know the math doesnâ€™t add up â€“ we hope you get the idea!</p>
            <p>With just intermittent walks outside, the 1893 Worldâ€™s Fair Tour makes for a great walking tour in all seasons. This tourÂ makes the Worldâ€™s Fairâ€™s lasting impact come to life. We hope youâ€™ll join us!</p>

            <p>Join us for a historic Chicago pub crawl with an educational twist! Youâ€™ll explore Chicagoâ€™s entertainment history and learn about prohibition, jazz, theater, vices, and social clubs, all while enjoying drinks and appetizers. Guests interact with historic photos and videos on shared iPads and visit historic buildings for three drink stops. We donâ€™t walk far on our evening walking tour, giving us more time to engage with Chicago history and look at architecture. The limited walking distance on the tour gives us time to enjoy our appetizers and choice of wine or beer.</p>
            <p>Tour groups see magnificent lobbies and really engage with some beautiful historic architecture. Many tour guests enjoy the social dynamic of this unique tour. Solo travelers often join the tour. Also as a great Chicago date idea, it can be a fun thing to do in Chicago with your boyfriend or girlfriend. Groups of friends make the tour into a cool weekend event as itâ€™s more than a Chicago pub crawl â€“ youâ€™ll eat, drink, and learn about architecture, Prohibition-era history, and culture.Stories and Ideas on the Historic Chicago Pub Crawl Tour:Architecture as a cultural artifactThe â€œHex of the Billy Goatâ€Chicago jazz eraHistory of Chicago breweriesProhibition and gangstersHistoric restaurant trends1960â€™s nightlifePrivate clubs</p>

            <p>The Loop Interior Architecture Walking Tour takes you on a creative route that weaves through buildings and secret short-cuts. 95% of the tour takes place inside, making it great for any kind of weather.Tour guests share iPads with archival images of maps, historic photos and documentary video clips while the tour guide shares stories of Chicago history. Our fun and passionate tour guides are highly trained professionals with degrees in architecture, design, art history and history. They know how to connect with a group, spark imaginations, and communicate new concepts in relating to architecture.Looking at the outside of buildings, such as with architectural boat tours, can be a great first step in engaging with Chicago architecture. For the next level of connection with Chicago architecture, go inside of the buildings. You will appreciate Chicago architecture from new perspectives. From the interiors, you can truly experience architectural space rather than from the more isolated perspective of a downtown sidewalk.Â</p>

This is the perfect girls' night, date night or team building experience!</p>
            <p>We will be covering introductory glass cutting and hand pouring of each candle with soy wax. Choose from different cocktail scents such as Barrel Aged Bourbon, Old Fashioned Cocktail or Whiskey &amp; Sweet Tobacco! Have fun learning something new and feel great that you will be taking home a premium soy candle without that high-end price tag.</p>

You will see a big loading dock area, go up the wood stairs and there is a glass door on the RIGHT corner- you will enter there. Code for the door is *0105 and come up to the 4th floor, hang a right and walk all the way down. You will smell candles...follow your nose! ;)</p>

            <p>Warm up this January and get growing in the heart of winter. In this workshop, you'll learn the basics of how to create an air plant terrarium and how to keep your plants happy and healthy from master gardenerÂ Leelee Dameron. Then pick from a variety of materials, glassware, Â air plants, and crystals to create your own garden under glass.</p>
            <p>Leelee will show you all her tips and tricks for terrarium-making. You'llÂ learn the basics of how to care for the popular and easy-to-grow Tillandsia (air plantsâ€”they need a little more love than just air alone!). You'll have a ton of different optionsÂ of plants, sand, shells, and other natural decor to choose from plus get 1:1 help from Leelee to create your own terrarium in the second half of class.Â</p>
            <p>If you want your terrarium to have a theme, intention (how about a 2019 goals garden?), or just something sparkly, we will have a selection of rough gemstones on hand, along with their meanings, for you to choose from. With step-by-step instructions, you will create a stunning terrarium to inspire you every day.</p>
            <p>No two terrariums will look alike at the end of this unique workshop, and you'll end up with a beautiful, unique work of art to decorate your home, office, or next event.Â</p>
            <p>This workshop will be held atÂ Leelee's home studio (and indoor jungle) in Avondale/North Logan Square (address provided upon purchase). Get inspired for your 2019 #plantgoals and ask Leelee any quesitons you have about general plant care too. Â BYOB.</p>

            <p>Explore the exciting world of Glass Art in your own Exclusive Private Lesson. Enjoy 2 hours of Glassblowing at one of the coolest venues in Chicago. Receive 1-on-1 guidance and learn to form molten glass into works of Art. Private Lessons are completely customized to the needs of the student(s).Â</p>
            <p>Begin with a brief safety talk and Glassblowing demonstration. Then take turns to design and make your own! Choose from Hearts, Paperweights, Double-Walled Bowls, Flowers, Cups, Hanging Ornaments, Vases, Pumpkins, and more. Typically 2-4 projects can be made in this amount of time depending on how many people are in your group and the complication level of your projects.</p>
            <p>The location of this class will be determined based upon your preferred day and time. I am an independent artist and I teach these classes out of a few different spaces. Since the calendars at the studios change from day to day, it's easiest for you to select your day and time, then I will book us a space. Important safety information will be sent to you in an email with the exact address of the studio, but if you need more information before you sign up, just send me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as my hands are free.</p>
            <p>Don't see the date you want? Want to host a Private Event? For this and all other inquiries, scroll down or click here and use the SEND MESSAGE button. I typically get back to you right away.</p>
            <p>Projects will need up to 72 hours to cool properly before they will be ready for local delivery ($10-15), shipping ($15-20), or pick-up (free).</p>
            <p>Â</p>
            <p>Â</p>
            <p>FAQ's:</p>
            <p>Q: Is it BYOB?</p>
            <p>A: Some of my venues are BYOB friendly and some are not. If you prefer a BYOB space just let me know!</p>
            <p>Â</p>
            <p>Q: Is the price $250 per person or $250 for the whole thing?</p>
            <p>A: The price is $250 for the whole lesson. This is the price for 2 hours and it includes 1-4 people. You will need to sign up for 1 person regardless of the size of your group. The cost will always be $250 in total. It's very helpful if you send me a message with an estimate of your groupsize.</p>
            <p>Â</p>
            <p>Q: How does it work? Does everybody work at the same time?</p>
            <p>A: Each person will take a turn making their project and usually only 1 person can make their project at a time. It usually takes about 25 minutes to make each project, with some time for set up and water breaks in between. Usually,Â each person takes a turn (or turns) making projects until the time is over. I'll make sure each person will get at least one turn. While students are not making their projects, they may help or observe our group, or there may be other artists in the studio to watch as well. (For larger groups we can have 2, 3, or 4 people making projects at one time. We can even "piggyback" the order so that we can accomodate groups of 50+ people in roughly 2.5 hours.)</p>
            <p>Â</p>
            <p>Q: Can I give this as a gift?</p>
            <p>A: Yes. You can sign up and then schedule later by sending me a message. I'll provide you with a private link. If you'd like I'll send you a digital or actual gift certificate for presentation.</p>
            <p>Â</p>
            <p>Q: Are there restrictions?</p>
            <p>A: Anyone under 18 will need to be accompanied by a guardian. Everyone will be expected to follow simple safety rules. (Don't touch this, don't walk backwards, etc) If the guardian understands that the minor will need to try to follow instructions, I'm ok with it. Please send me a message to let me know you are bringing minors. Otherwise, I am completely accomodating to all different limitiations and abilities.Â</p>
