      "description": "Self defense is the greatest gift you can give yourself or a love one. This class is an introduction to the Japanese martial art called Aikido. The term Aikido means Ki harmonizing way. Ki is the term that refers to the universal energizing principle similar to the Chinese Chi.  In the martial art of  Aikido, an opponent is defeated by leading his Ki in such a way that he defeats himself. Thus In Aikido paradoxically to attack is weak because the action of attacking gives the defender the means to defeat the hostile effort. This concept sets Aikido apart from all other martial arts forms. In addition, the use of an opponents force to subdue makes Aikido an ideal martial art for women and children.  It is indeed the way of the peaceful warrior. Although one can study Aikido for a lifetime, enough of the basic concepts and techniques of self-defense can be explored in a 2-hour workshop to quite possibly save a life.",
